# File Transfer Script

This repository contains a simple file transfer script (`file_transfer.sh`) that simulates the transfer of a file between a local machine and a remote server. While the script itself is relatively simple, it implicitly demonstrates several key concepts and processes related to SSH, file transfers, and authentication.

## Key Concepts Behind the Script

While the script may appear minimal, it leverages various underlying mechanisms such as:

### 1. **SSH Key-based Authentication**
   - The script uses SSH to securely authenticate the user with the remote server.
   - It requires setting up an SSH key pair (public and private keys) for the client machine and adding the client’s public key to the server’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file.
   - This avoids the need for password-based login and ensures a secure connection.

### 2. **Public/Private Key Pair Exchange**
   - When you run the script, the client initiates an SSH connection and performs an authentication process that involves the exchange of public keys.
   - The server's public key is checked against the client's `known_hosts` file to verify the server’s identity, ensuring that the client is connecting to the correct server (preventing man-in-the-middle attacks).
   - The client’s private key is used to authenticate the user to the server.

### 3. **Secure File Transfer**
   - The file transfer itself is conducted over the SSH connection, using a secure and encrypted protocol to ensure the file is transferred safely.
   - The `scp` or `rsync` commands are commonly used in such scripts to copy files securely over SSH.

### 4. **Error Handling and Logging**
   - The script could include mechanisms to handle errors (e.g., failed transfers, network issues) and log activity to ensure the user is informed of the success or failure of the transfer.

### 5. **Setting up the Environment**
   - The script assumes SSH keys are set up on both the client and server. If not, the user must manually configure SSH key pairs and set up proper file permissions on both systems.
   - This process usually involves running `ssh-keygen` to generate the SSH keys and copying the public key to the server using `ssh-copy-id`.

## Usage

1. **Set up SSH keys**: Before using this script, ensure that you have generated SSH keys and configured them on both the client and the server.
2. **Run the script**: 
   ```bash
   ./file_transfer.sh
